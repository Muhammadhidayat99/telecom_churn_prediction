# üìû Telecom Churn Prediction

This repository presents an end-to-end Machine Learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. 

Customer churn is a critical business problem, as retaining existing customers is significantly more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.

## üéØ Project Objective

The primary goal of this project is to develop and evaluate a robust predictive model that can accurately identify telecom customers who are at high risk of churning. By pinpointing these at-risk customers, telecom companies can implement targeted retention strategies, thereby reducing customer attrition and maximizing lifetime value.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Methodologies

* **Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis to understand customer demographics, service usage patterns, and their correlation with churn behavior.
* **Comprehensive Data Preprocessing:**
    * Handling missing values and outliers.
    * Encoding categorical features (One-Hot Encoding).
    * Feature scaling (StandardScaler).
    * Feature engineering to create more informative variables.
* **Machine Learning Model Development:** Implementation and comparison of various classification algorithms, including:
    * Logistic Regression
    * Random Forest Classifier
    * Gradient Boosting Classifier
    * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
    * Neural Networks (MLP Classifier)
* **Robust Model Evaluation:** Assessment of model performance using key metrics relevant to imbalanced datasets:
    * Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
    * ROC AUC Score & ROC Curves
    * Confusion Matrices
* **Imbalanced Data Handling:** Strategies employed to address the common class imbalance in churn datasets (e.g., `class_weight='balanced'` for Logistic Regression, consideration of oversampling/undersampling techniques).
* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilization of techniques like GridSearchCV for optimizing model performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy:** Numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization.
* **Scikit-learn:** Machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and presentation.
